# ERP-Inventory-Management-system

The goal is to create a web application using Flask framework to manage inventory of a list of products in respective warehouses. Imagine this application will be used in a shop or a warehouse that needs to keep track of various products and various locations.

I used vagrant tool for building and managing virtualmachine environments in a single workflow.
